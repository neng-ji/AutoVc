# Overview
We will construct neural network layers using PyTorch for use with the system described in ["AUTOVC: Zero-Shot Voice Style Transfer with Only Autoencoder Loss"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05879) (ICML 2019) by Qian, Zhang, Chang, Yang, and Hasegawa-Johnson. 


You do not need to download `target_utterance`, `source_utterance`, or `converted_utterance`. You can create your own and test them yourself.
